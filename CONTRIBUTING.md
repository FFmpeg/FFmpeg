# Note to Github users
Patches should be submitted to the [ffmpeg-devel mailing list](https://ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel) using `git format-patch` or `git send-email`. Github pull requests should be avoided because they are not part of our review process and **will be ignored**.

See [https://ffmpeg.org/developer.html#Contributing](https://ffmpeg.org/developer.html#Contributing) for more information.
