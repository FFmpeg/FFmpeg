version 0.4.5:

- some header fixes (Zdenek Kabelac <kabi@informatics.muni.cz>).
- many MMX optimizations (Nick Kurshev <nickols_k@mail.ru>).
- added configure system (actually a small shell script).
- added mpeg audio layer 1/2/3 decoding using LGPL'ed mpglib by
  Michael Hipp (temporary solution - waiting for integer only
  decoder).
- fixed VIDIOCSYNC interrupt.
- added Intel H263 decoding support ('I263' avi fourCC)
- added Real Video 1.0 decoding (needs further testing).
- simplified image formats again. Added PGM format (=grey
  pgm). Renamed old PGM to PGMYUV.
- fixed msmpeg4 slice issues (tell me if you still find problems).
- fixed opendivx bugs with newer versions (added VOL header decoding).
- added support for mplayer interface.
- added macroblock skip optimization.
- added MJPEG decoder.
- added mmx/mmxext idct from libmpeg2.
- added pgmyuvpipe, ppm, and ppm_pipe formats (original patch by Celer
  <celer@shell.scrypt.net>).
- added pixel format convertion layer (e.g. for MJPEG or PPM).
- added deinterlacing option.

version 0.4.4:

- fixed some std header definitions (Bjorn Lindgren
  <bjorn.e.lindgren@telia.com>).
- added mpeg demux (mpeg 1 and 2 compatible).
- added ASF demux.
- added prototype RM demux.
- added AC3 decoding (done with libac3 by Aaron Holtzman).
- added decoding codec parameter guessing (.e.g. for mpeg, because the
  header does not include them).
- fixed header generation in mpeg1, AVI and ASF mux : wmplayer can now
  play them (only tested video).
- fixed h263 white bug.
- fixed phase rounding in img resample filter.
- add mmx code for polyphase img resample filter.
- added CPU autodetect.
- added generic title/author/copyright/comment string handling (ASF and RM use them).
- added SWF demux to extract MP3 track (not usable yet because no MP3
  decoder).
- added fractional frame rate support.
- codecs are no longer searched by read_header() (should fix ffserver
  segfault).

version 0.4.3:

- BGR24 patch (initial patch by Jeroen Vreeken <pe1rxq@amsat.org>).
- fixed raw yuv output.
- added motion rounding support in MPEG4.
- fixed motion bug rounding in MSMPEG4.
- added B frame handling in video core.
- added full MPEG1 decoding support.
- added partial (frame only) MPEG2 support.
- changed the FOURCC code for H.263 to "U263" to be able to see the
+AVI/H.263 file with the UB Video H.263+ decoder. MPlayer works with
this +codec ;) (JuanJo).
- Halfpel motion estimation after mb type selection (JuanJo).
- added pgm and .Y.U.V output format.
- suppressed 'img:' protocol. Simply use: /tmp/test%d.[pgm|Y] as input or
  output.
- added pgmpipe I/O format (original patch from Martin Aumueller
  <lists@reserv.at>, but changed completely since we use a format
  instead of a protocol).

version 0.4.2:

- added H263/MPEG4/MSMPEG4 decoding support. MPEG4 decoding support
  (for openDIVX) is almost complete: 8x8 MVs and rounding are
  missing. MSMPEG4 support is complete.
- added prototype MPEG1 decoder. Only I and P frames handled yet (it
  can decode ffmpeg mpegs :-)).
- added libavcodec API documentation (see apiexample.c).
- fixed image polyphase bug (the bottom of some images could be
  greenish).
- added support for non clipped motion vectors (decoding only)
  and image sizes non multiple of 16.
- added support for AC prediction (decoding only).
- added file overwrite confirmation (can be disabled with -y).
- Added custom size picture to H.263 using H.263+ (Juanjo).

version 0.4.1:

- added MSMPEG4 (aka DIVX) compatible encoder. Changed default codec
  of avi and asf to DIV3.
- added -me option to set motion estimation method
  (default=log). suppressed redundant -hq option.
- added options -acodec and -vcodec to force a given codec (useful for
  AVI for example).
- fixed -an option.
- improved dct_quantize speed.
- factorized some motion estimation code.

version 0.4.0:

- removing grab code from ffserver and moved it to ffmpeg. Added multi
  stream support to ffmpeg.
- added timeshifting support for live feeds (option ?date=xxx in the
  URL).
- added high quality image resize code with polyphase filter (need
  mmx/see optimisation). Enable multiple image size support in ffserver.
- added multi live feed support in ffserver.
- suppressed master feature from ffserver (it should be done with an
  external program which opens the .ffm url and writes it to another
  ffserver).
- added preliminary support for video stream parsing (wav and avi half
  done). Added proper support for audio/video file convertion in
  ffmpeg.
- added preliminary support for video file sending from ffserver.
- redesigning I/O subsystem : now using URL based input and output
  (see avio.h).
- added wav format support.
- added "tty user interface" to ffmpeg to stop grabbing gracefully.
- added MMX/SSE optimizations to SAD (Sums of Absolutes Diferences)
  (Juan J. Sierralta P. a.k.a. "Juanjo" <juanjo@atmlab.utfsm.cl>).
- added MMX DCT from mpeg2_movie 1.5 (Juanjo).
- added new motion estimation algorithms, log and phods (Juanjo).
- changed directories : libav for format handling, libavcodec for
  codecs.

version 0.3.4:

- added stereo in mpeg audio encoder.

version 0.3.3:

- added 'high quality' mode which use motion vectors. It can be used in
  real time at low resolution.
- fixed rounding problems which caused quality problems at high
  bitrates and large gop size.

version 0.3.2: small fixes

- asf fixes
- put_seek bug fix

version 0.3.1: added avi/divx support

- added avi support
- added mpeg4 codec compatible with open divx. It is based on the h263
  codec.
- added sound for flash format (not tested)

version 0.3: initial public release
