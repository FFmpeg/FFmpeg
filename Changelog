version 0.9:

- openal input device added
- boxblur filter added
- BWF muxer
- Flash Screen Video 2 decoder
- lavfi input device added
- added avconv, which is almost the same for now, except
for a few incompatible changes in the options, which will hopefully make them
easier to use. The changes are:
    * The options placement is now strictly enforced! While in theory the
      options for ffmpeg should be given in [input options] -i INPUT [output
      options] OUTPUT order, in practice it was possible to give output options
      before the -i and it mostly worked. Except when it didn't - the behavior was
      a bit inconsistent. In avconv, it is not possible to mix input and output
      options. All non-global options are reset after an input or output filename.
    * All per-file options are now truly per-file - they apply only to the next
      input or output file and specifying different values for different files
      will now work properly (notably -ss and -t options).
    * All per-stream options are now truly per-stream - it is possible to
      specify which stream(s) should a given option apply to. See the Stream
      specifiers section in the avconv manual for details.
    * In ffmpeg some options (like -newvideo/-newaudio/...) are irregular in the
      sense that they're specified after the output filename instead of before,
      like all other options. In avconv this irregularity is removed, all options
      apply to the next input or output file.
    * -newvideo/-newaudio/-newsubtitle options were removed. Not only were they
      irregular and highly confusing, they were also redundant. In avconv the -map
      option will create new streams in the output file and map input streams to
      them. E.g. avconv -i INPUT -map 0 OUTPUT will create an output stream for
      each stream in the first input file.
    * The -map option now has slightly different and more powerful syntax:
        + Colons (':') are used to separate file index/stream type/stream index
          instead of dots. Comma (',') is used to separate the sync stream instead
          of colon.. This is done for consistency with other options.
        + It's possible to specify stream type. E.g. -map 0:a:2 creates an
          output stream from the third input audio stream.
        + Omitting the stream index now maps all the streams of the given type,
          not just the first. E.g. -map 0:s creates output streams for all the
          subtitle streams in the first input file.
        + Since -map can now match multiple streams, negative mappings were
          introduced. Negative mappings disable some streams from an already
          defined map. E.g. '-map 0 -map -0:a:1' means 'create output streams for
          all the stream in the first input file, except for the second audio
          stream'.
    * There is a new option -c (or -codec) for choosing the decoder/encoder to
      use, which allows to precisely specify target stream(s) consistently with
      other options. E.g. -c:v lib264 sets the codec for all video streams, -c:a:0
      libvorbis sets the codec for the first audio stream and -c copy copies all
      the streams without reencoding. Old -vcodec/-acodec/-scodec options are now
      aliases to -c:v/a/s
    * It is now possible to precisely specify which stream should an AVOption
      apply to. E.g. -b:v:0 2M sets the bitrate for the first video stream, while
      -b:a 128k sets the bitrate for all audio streams. Note that the old -ab 128k
      syntax is deprecated and will stop working soon.
    * -map_chapters now takes only an input file index and applies to the next
      output file. This is consistent with how all the other options work.
    * -map_metadata now takes only an input metadata specifier and applies to
      the next output file. Output metadata specifier is now part of the option
      name, similarly to the AVOptions/map/codec feature above.
    * -metadata can now be used to set metadata on streams and chapters, e.g.
      -metadata:s:1 language=eng sets the language of the first stream to 'eng'.
      This made -vlang/-alang/-slang options redundant, so they were removed.
    * -qscale option now uses stream specifiers and applies to all streams, not
      just video. I.e. plain -qscale number would now apply to all streams. To get
      the old behavior, use -qscale:v. Also there is now a shortcut -q for -qscale
      and -aq is now an alias for -q:a.
    * -vbsf/-absf/-sbsf options were removed and replaced by a -bsf option which
      uses stream specifiers. Use -bsf:v/a/s instead of the old options.
    * -itsscale option now uses stream specifiers, so its argument is only the
      scale parameter.
    * -intra option was removed, use -g 0 for the same effect.
    * -psnr option was removed, use -flags +psnr for the same effect.
    * -vf option is now an alias to the new -filter option, which uses stream specifiers.
    * -vframes/-aframes/-dframes options are now aliases to the new -frames option.
    * -vtag/-atag/-stag options are now aliases to the new -tag option.
