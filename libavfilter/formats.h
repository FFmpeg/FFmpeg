/**
 * A list of supported formats for one end of a filter link. This is used
 * during the format negotiation process to try to pick the best format to
 * use to minimize the number of necessary conversions. Each filter gives a
 * list of the formats supported by each input and output pad. The list
 * given for each pad need not be distinct - they may be references to the
 * same list of formats, as is often the case when a filter supports multiple
 * formats, but will always output the same format as it is given in input.
 *
 * In this way, a list of possible input formats and a list of possible
 * output formats are associated with each link. When a set of formats is
 * negotiated over a link, the input and output lists are merged to form a
 * new list containing only the common elements of each list. In the case
 * that there were no common elements, a format conversion is necessary.
 * Otherwise, the lists are merged, and all other links which reference
 * either of the format lists involved in the merge are also affected.
 *
 * For example, consider the filter chain:
 * filter (a) --> (b) filter (b) --> (c) filter
 *
 * where the letters in parenthesis indicate a list of formats supported on
 * the input or output of the link. Suppose the lists are as follows:
 * (a) = {A, B}
 * (b) = {A, B, C}
 * (c) = {B, C}
 *
 * First, the first link's lists are merged, yielding:
 * filter (a) --> (a) filter (a) --> (c) filter
 *
 * Notice that format list (b) now refers to the same list as filter list (a).
 * Next, the lists for the second link are merged, yielding:
 * filter (a) --> (a) filter (a) --> (a) filter
 *
 * where (a) = {B}.
 *
 * Unfortunately, when the format lists at the two ends of a link are merged,
 * we must ensure that all links which reference either pre-merge format list
 * get updated as well. Therefore, we have the format list structure store a
 * pointer to each of the pointers to itself.

/**
 * Callbacks and properties to describe the steps of a format negotiation.
 *
 * The steps are:
 *
 * 1. query_formats(): call the callbacks on all filter to set lists of
 *                     supported formats.
 *                     When links on a filter must eventually have the same
 *                     format, the lists of supported formats are the same
 *                     object in memory.
 *                     See:
 *                     http://www.normalesup.org/~george/articles/format_negotiation_in_libavfilter/#12
 *
 *
 * 2. query_formats(): merge lists of supported formats or insert automatic
 *                     conversion filters.
 *                     Compute the intersection of the lists of supported
 *                     formats on the ends of links. If it succeeds, replace
 *                     both objects with the intersection everywhere they
 *                     are referenced.
 *                     If the intersection is empty, insert an automatic
 *                     conversion filter.
 *                     If several formats are negotiated at once (format,
 *                     rate, layout), only merge if all three can be, since
 *                     the conversion filter can convert all three at once.
 *                     This process goes on as long as progress is made.
 *                     See:
 *                     http://www.normalesup.org/~george/articles/format_negotiation_in_libavfilter/#14
 *                     http://www.normalesup.org/~george/articles/format_negotiation_in_libavfilter/#29
 *
 * 3. reduce_formats(): try to reduce format conversion within filters.
 *                      For each link where there is only one supported
 *                      formats on output, for each output of the connected
 *                      filter, if the media type is the same and said
 *                      format is supported, keep only this one.
 *                      This process goes on as long as progress is made.
 *                      Rationale: conversion filters will set a large list
 *                      of supported formats on outputs but users will
 *                      expect the output to be as close as possible as the
 *                      input (examples: scale without changing the pixel
 *                      format, resample without changint the layout).
 *                      FIXME: this can probably be done by merging the
 *                      input and output lists instead of re-implementing
 *                      the logic.
 *
 * 4. swap_sample_fmts():
 *    swap_samplerates():
 *    swap_channel_layouts(): For each filter with an input with only one
 *                            supported format, when outputs have several
 *                            supported formats, put the best one with
 *                            reference to the input at the beginning of the
 *                            list, to prepare it for being picked up by
 *                            pick_formats().
 *                            The best format is the one that is most
 *                            similar to the input while not losing too much
 *                            information.
 *                            This process need to run only once.
 *                            FIXME: reduce_formats() operates on all inputs
 *                            with a single format, swap_*() operates on the
 *                            first one only: check if the difference makes
 *                            sense.
 *                            TODO: the swapping done for one filter can
 *                            override the swapping done for another filter
 *                            connected to the same list of formats, maybe
 *                            it would be better to compute a total score
 *                            for all connected filters and use the score to
 *                            pick the format instead of just swapping.
 *                            TODO: make the similarity logic available as
 *                            public functions in libavutil.
 *
 * 5. pick_formats(): Choose one format from the lists of supported formats,
 *                    use it for the link and reduce the list to a single
 *                    element to force other filters connected to the same
 *                    list to use it.
 *                    First process all links where there is a single format
 *                    and the output links of all filters with an input,
 *                    trying to preserve similarity between input and
 *                    outputs.
 *                    Repeat as long as process is made.
 *                    Then do a final run for the remaining filters.
 *                    FIXME: the similarity logic (the ref argument to
 *                    pick_format()) added in FFmpeg duplicates and
 *                    overrides the swapping logic added in libav. Better
 *                    merge them into a score system.
