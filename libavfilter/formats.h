/**
 * A list of supported formats for one end of a filter link. This is used
 * during the format negotiation process to try to pick the best format to
 * use to minimize the number of necessary conversions. Each filter gives a
 * list of the formats supported by each input and output pad. The list
 * given for each pad need not be distinct - they may be references to the
 * same list of formats, as is often the case when a filter supports multiple
 * formats, but will always output the same format as it is given in input.
 *
 * In this way, a list of possible input formats and a list of possible
 * output formats are associated with each link. When a set of formats is
 * negotiated over a link, the input and output lists are merged to form a
 * new list containing only the common elements of each list. In the case
 * that there were no common elements, a format conversion is necessary.
 * Otherwise, the lists are merged, and all other links which reference
 * either of the format lists involved in the merge are also affected.
 *
 * For example, consider the filter chain:
 * filter (a) --> (b) filter (b) --> (c) filter
 *
 * where the letters in parenthesis indicate a list of formats supported on
 * the input or output of the link. Suppose the lists are as follows:
 * (a) = {A, B}
 * (b) = {A, B, C}
 * (c) = {B, C}
 *
 * First, the first link's lists are merged, yielding:
 * filter (a) --> (a) filter (a) --> (c) filter
 *
 * Notice that format list (b) now refers to the same list as filter list (a).
 * Next, the lists for the second link are merged, yielding:
 * filter (a) --> (a) filter (a) --> (a) filter
 *
 * where (a) = {B}.
 *
 * Unfortunately, when the format lists at the two ends of a link are merged,
 * we must ensure that all links which reference either pre-merge format list
 * get updated as well. Therefore, we have the format list structure store a
 * pointer to each of the pointers to itself.
