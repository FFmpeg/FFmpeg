1) Type './configure' create the configuration (use './configure
--help' to have the configure options). 

'configure' can be launched from another directory than the ffmpeg
sources to put the objects at that place. In that case, use an
absolute path when launching 'configure',
e.g. /ffmpegdir/ffmpeg/configure.

2) Then type 'make' to build ffmpeg.

3) Type 'make install' to install ffmpeg and ffserver in
/usr/local/bin.
