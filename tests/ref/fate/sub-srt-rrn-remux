Wooldoor:
the producers decided
to surprise one of us

5
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,990
With a visit from
a family member.

6
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,191
I hope it's someone
from my family

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,493

Look, everyone!
Someone's coming!

Clara: the second I saw
the horse and carriage,

12
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:47,079
I just knew it had
to be someone from
my kingdom.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,683
But when I saw it was
the short carriage,
my heart sank.

14
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,786
Why?! Why did she
have to come?!

15
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,588
Oh, fuck me.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:03,362
Um, everyone, this is
my special cousin bleh.

Foxxy: no one knew clara

19
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,132
Had a mentally-challenged
cousin, but it was cool.

20
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,269
The foxxy five used to perform
for special needs kids,

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,306

Well, this has
been fun. Bye!

28
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,397
Well, i've never seen
someone that slow
go that fast.

29
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,132
Oh, yeah! Give it up!

00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:59,952
Oh, poor ling-ling.
He's so disappointed
his father didn't show.

33
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,387
Oh!

34
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,590
Oh, sweetie,
i'm so sorry your
father's not coming.

Don't we, toot?!

Let's go, bleh.
The coast is clear.

42
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,746

no more potty breaks.

45
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,786
I know it seemed
like I was ashamed
of my cousin,

46
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,921
But nothing could be
further from the truth.

47
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,591
Aah!
Foxxy:
hey, clara!

48
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,060
What's up, girlfriend?

49
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,062
You know,
none of us have
really had a chance

50
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,763
To hang out
with bleh yet.

51
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,232
Bleh? What's a bleh?

52
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,835
Is that one of your
jive words like
"emancipation"?

53
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,603
No, bleh your cousin.

54
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:55,808
Uh, clara?
Why is the lamp drooling?

55
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:59,044
I guess to remind us
to conserve electricity.

56
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:03,248
Clara, there is
no reason to be
embarrassed by your cousin.

57
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,085
Embarrassed?
I'm not embarrassed.

58
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,321
Stop pretending
bleh is a lamp.

59
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,824
She is not a lamp,
clara.

60
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:15,160
She is a real person
with real feelings.

61
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,096
Foxxy was probably right.

62
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,864
Damn that ms. Know-it-all!

63
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,400
I should have killed her
when I had the chance.

64
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,835
Give me your hand!

65
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,603
First, give me the ring!

00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,208
Xandir:
it just didn't make sense.

68
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,709
When we licked ling-ling
last time,

69
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,877
We got all [bleep]ed up.

70
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,479
But this time, nothing happened.

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,047
Well, we got a little aroused,

72
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,982
But not [bleep]ed up.

73
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,517
Uhh! What's the deal-e-o?

74
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,085
I don't feel
anything. You?

75
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,086
Nothing.

76
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,755
[kisses]

77
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,858
Hmm. Maybe we have to
eat ling-ling.

78
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,326
Why is it when
something doesn't work,

79
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,228
Your first reaction
is to eat it?

80
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,631
What?! What
are you doing?

81
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,067
I couldn't find
the remote.

82
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,735
You know,
there is one person

83
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,203
Who can figure this out.

84
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,705
The professor!
The professor!

88
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,577
Got it.
Hit the lights.

89
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,717
Here you see
the african camel toad.

90
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,118
It secretes
a hallucinogen

91
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,153
Whenever it's scared.

92
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,320
Ahh!

93
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,423
Yeah, that's--oh,
I didn't know that.

94
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,360
When "cool" kids feel
like catching a "buzz,"

95
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:25,064
They scare the amphibian
and then lick its skin.

96
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,166
All the cool kids,
you say?

97
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:31,036
Now take ling-ling,
the asian trading card
battle monster.

98
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,638
It creates a similar
hallucinogen

99
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,807
Whenever it's
disappointed.

100
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,443
Ahh!
Oh, I want to
be cool!

101
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,946
So, ling-ling
was experiencing
disappointment

102
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,614
Due to its
father's absence,

103
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,183
Then, upon kissing
ling-ling,

104
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:47,186
You became...[wacky
noises] technically
speaking.

105
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:53,692

is disappointed, eh? Hmm.

Foxxy: it looked like I got
through to the princess.

112
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,881
Clara would see that
there ain't no reason
to be ashamed of bleh.

113

We all adults.

join you guys?

Of course not.

how hot she is,

Clara:
I found it a bit odd

181
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,023
That captain hero
wanted to take bleh
out on a date,

182
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,691
And it was
my responsibility

183
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,127
To make sure his
intentions were pure.

184
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,329
So, captain hero, is it?

185
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,464
Oh. Heh heh! Yeah?

186
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,966

my little bleh out

187
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,634
For a night
on the town, eh?

188
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,770
You know, I don't
know what'd I do

189
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,805
If anything happened
to my little bleh.

190
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,341
Yes, ma'am.
I mean, no, ma'am.

191
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,943
Son, do you know
what it's like

192
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,147
To kill a man with
your bare hands?

193
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,748
I do.

194
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:10,883
I...

195
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,151
Oh!

196
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,986
Here's bleh now!

197
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,155

198
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,825

A little
added protection.

203
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,807
You'll get the antidote
when I get my bleh back.

Too bad there's
no such thing
as santa claus!

I bet you're
disappointed.

Hey, look what
I found in your ear!

211
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,427
Is it a quarter?

212
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,330
Oh, no!
It's a tumor!

00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,765

Captain hero:
yes, I was confident

223
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,327
That by the end of the
night, i'd have another
notch on my utility belt

224
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,095
And 50 bucks in my pocket.

225
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,565
Then I realized
something. Bleh...

226
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,034
She was really special,

227
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,635
But not like in
a retarded way,

228

310
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,945
Still, I needed to
sit clara down and
explain what happened.

311
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,948
Clara, I never expected
this to happen.

312

with sticks?

354
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:49,181
Oh, we've abused ling-ling
to the point where the
little guy is just numb.

355
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,649
And for what?

356
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,551
To catch a buzz?!

357
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,654
I guess being cool
just isn't worth it.

Sorry, wooldoor.
You stay here

Until all that ling-ling
is out of your system.

362
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,135
It's gonna be

Captain hero:
oh, sure, the money
helped dull the pain,

370
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:33,692
But later, you know, when
the stores are all closed,

371
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,294
Who do I have
to share it with?

Bleh? No. Not anymore.
Not anymore.

It just wasn't
worth it, spanky!

Bleh, she--
she was special.

376
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:52,678
Oh, spanky,
I love her.

377

we knew what we had done
to ling-ling was wrong.

Hopefully, this was gonna

380
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,622
Make it up to that lovable,

Hah! You're too late,

394
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,630
