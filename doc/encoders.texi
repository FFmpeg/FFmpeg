@chapter Encoders
@c man begin ENCODERS

Encoders are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow the encoding of
multimedia streams.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported native encoders
are enabled by default. Encoders requiring an external library must be enabled
manually via the corresponding @code{--enable-lib} option. You can list all
available encoders using the configure option @code{--list-encoders}.

You can disable all the encoders with the configure option
@code{--disable-encoders} and selectively enable / disable single encoders
with the options @code{--enable-encoder=@var{ENCODER}} /
@code{--disable-encoder=@var{ENCODER}}.

The option @code{-encoders} of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled encoders.

@chapter Audio Encoders
@c man begin AUDIO ENCODERS

A description of some of the currently available audio encoders
follows.

@anchor{aacenc}
@section aac

Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoder.

This encoder is an experimental FFmpeg-native AAC encoder. Currently only the
low complexity (AAC-LC) profile is supported. To use this encoder, you must set
@option{strict} option to @samp{experimental} or lower.

As this encoder is experimental, unexpected behavior may exist from time to
time. For a more stable AAC encoder, see @ref{libvo-aacenc}. However, be warned
that it has a worse quality reported by some users.

@c todo @ref{libaacplus}
See also @ref{libfdk-aac-enc,,libfdk_aac} and @ref{libfaac}.

@subsection Options

@table @option
@item b
Set bit rate in bits/s. Setting this automatically activates constant bit rate
(CBR) mode.

@item q
Set quality for variable bit rate (VBR) mode. This option is valid only using
the @command{ffmpeg} command-line tool. For library interface users, use
@option{global_quality}.

@item stereo_mode
Set stereo encoding mode. Possible values:

@table @samp
@item auto
Automatically selected by the encoder.

@item ms_off
Disable middle/side encoding. This is the default.

@item ms_force
Force middle/side encoding.
@end table

@item aac_coder
Set AAC encoder coding method. Possible values:

@table @samp
@item faac
FAAC-inspired method.

This method is a simplified reimplementation of the method used in FAAC, which
sets thresholds proportional to the band energies, and then decreases all the
thresholds with quantizer steps to find the appropriate quantization with
distortion below threshold band by band.

The quality of this method is comparable to the two loop searching method
described below, but somewhat a little better and slower.

@item anmr
Average noise to mask ratio (ANMR) trellis-based solution.

This has a theoretic best quality out of all the coding methods, but at the
cost of the slowest speed.

@item twoloop
Two loop searching (TLS) method.

This method first sets quantizers depending on band thresholds and then tries
to find an optimal combination by adding or subtracting a specific value from
all quantizers and adjusting some individual quantizer a little.

This method produces similar quality with the FAAC method and is the default.

@item fast
Constant quantizer method.

This method sets a constant quantizer for all bands. This is the fastest of all
the methods, yet produces the worst quality.

@end table

@end table

@section ac3 and ac3_fixed

AC-3 audio encoders.

These encoders implement part of ATSC A/52:2010 and ETSI TS 102 366, as well as
the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).

The @var{ac3} encoder uses floating-point math, while the @var{ac3_fixed}
encoder only uses fixed-point integer math. This does not mean that one is
always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
particular system. The floating-point encoder will generally produce better
quality audio for a given bitrate. The @var{ac3_fixed} encoder is not the
default codec for any of the output formats, so it must be specified explicitly
using the option @code{-acodec ac3_fixed} in order to use it.

@subsection AC-3 Metadata

The AC-3 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the audio,
but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some of the options
do directly affect or influence the decoding and playback of the resulting
bitstream, while others are just for informational purposes. A few of the
options will add bits to the output stream that could otherwise be used for
audio data, and will thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be
indicated accordingly with a note in the option list below.

These parameters are described in detail in several publicly-available
documents.

@subsubsection Audio Production Information
Audio Production Information is optional information describing the mixing
environment.  Either none or both of the fields are written to the bitstream.

@table @option

@item -mixing_level @var{number}
Mixing Level. Specifies peak sound pressure level (SPL) in the production
environment when the mix was mastered. Valid values are 80 to 111, or -1 for
unknown or not indicated. The default value is -1, but that value cannot be
used if the Audio Production Information is written to the bitstream. Therefore,
if the @code{room_type} option is not the default value, the @code{mixing_level}
option must not be -1.

@item -room_type @var{type}
Room Type. Describes the equalization used during the final mixing session at
the studio or on the dubbing stage. A large room is a dubbing stage with the
industry standard X-curve equalization; a small room has flat equalization.
This field will not be written to the bitstream if both the @code{mixing_level}

Dialogue Normalization. Indicates how far the average dialogue level of the
program is below digital 100% full scale (0 dBFS). This parameter determines a
level shift during audio reproduction that sets the average volume of the
dialogue to a preset level. The goal is to match volume level between program
sources. A value of -31dB will result in no volume level change, relative to
the source volume, during audio reproduction. Valid values are whole numbers in
the range -31 to -1, with -31 being the default.

@item -dsur_mode @var{mode}

@subsection Extended Bitstream Information
The extended bitstream options are part of the Alternate Bit Stream Syntax as
specified in Annex D of the A/52:2010 standard. It is grouped into 2 parts.
If any one parameter in a group is specified, all values in that group will be
written to the bitstream.  Default values are used for those that are written
but have not been specified.  If the mixing levels are written, the decoder
will use these values instead of the ones specified in the @code{center_mixlev}
and @code{surround_mixlev} options if it supports the Alternate Bit Stream
Syntax.

@subsection Other AC-3 Encoding Options

@table @option

@item -stereo_rematrixing @var{boolean}
Stereo Rematrixing. Enables/Disables use of rematrixing for stereo input. This
is an optional AC-3 feature that increases quality by selectively encoding
the left/right channels as mid/side. This option is enabled by default, and it
is highly recommended that it be left as enabled except for testing purposes.

@end table

@subsection Floating-Point-Only AC-3 Encoding Options

These options are only valid for the floating-point encoder and do not exist
for the fixed-point encoder due to the corresponding features not being
implemented in fixed-point.

@table @option

@item -channel_coupling @var{boolean}
Enables/Disables use of channel coupling, which is an optional AC-3 feature
that increases quality by combining high frequency information from multiple
channels into a single channel. The per-channel high frequency information is
sent with less accuracy in both the frequency and time domains. This allows
more bits to be used for lower frequencies while preserving enough information
to reconstruct the high frequencies. This option is enabled by default for the
floating-point encoder and should generally be left as enabled except for
testing purposes or to increase encoding speed.
@table @option
@item -1
@itemx auto
Selected by Encoder (default)
@item 0
@itemx off
Disable Channel Coupling
@item 1
@itemx on
Enable Channel Coupling
@end table

@item -cpl_start_band @var{number}
Coupling Start Band. Sets the channel coupling start band, from 1 to 15. If a
value higher than the bandwidth is used, it will be reduced to 1 less than the
coupling end band. If @var{auto} is used, the start band will be determined by
the encoder based on the bit rate, sample rate, and channel layout. This option
has no effect if channel coupling is disabled.
@table @option

applied after the first stage to finetune the coefficients. This is quite slow
and slightly improves compression.

@end table

@anchor{libfaac}
@section libfaac

libfaac AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) encoder wrapper.

Requires the presence of the libfaac headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@code{--enable-libfaac --enable-nonfree}.

This encoder is considered to be of higher quality with respect to the
@ref{aacenc,,the native experimental FFmpeg AAC encoder}.

For more information see the libfaac project at
@url{http://www.audiocoding.com/faac.html/}.

@subsection Options

The following shared FFmpeg codec options are recognized.

The following options are supported by the libfaac wrapper. The
@command{faac}-equivalent of the options are listed in parentheses.

@table @option
@item b (@emph{-b})
Set bit rate in bits/s for ABR (Average Bit Rate) mode. If the bit rate
is not explicitly specified, it is automatically set to a suitable
value depending on the selected profile. @command{faac} bitrate is
expressed in kilobits/s.

Note that libfaac does not support CBR (Constant Bit Rate) but only
ABR (Average Bit Rate).

If VBR mode is enabled this option is ignored.

@item ar (@emph{-R})
Set audio sampling rate (in Hz).

@item ac (@emph{-c})
Set the number of audio channels.

@item cutoff (@emph{-C})
Set cutoff frequency. If not specified (or explicitly set to 0) it
will use a value automatically computed by the library. Default value
is 0.

@item profile
Set audio profile.

The following profiles are recognized:
@table @samp
@item aac_main
Main AAC (Main)

@item aac_low
Low Complexity AAC (LC)

@item aac_ssr
Scalable Sample Rate (SSR)

@item aac_ltp
Long Term Prediction (LTP)
@end table

If not specified it is set to @samp{aac_low}.

@item flags +qscale
Set constant quality VBR (Variable Bit Rate) mode.

@item global_quality
Set quality in VBR mode as an integer number of lambda units.

Only relevant when VBR mode is enabled with @code{flags +qscale}.  The
value is converted to QP units by dividing it by @code{FF_QP2LAMBDA},
and used to set the quality value used by libfaac. A reasonable range
for the option value in QP units is [10-500], the higher the value the
higher the quality.

@item q (@emph{-q})
Enable VBR mode when set to a non-negative value, and set constant
quality value as a double floating point value in QP units.

The value sets the quality value used by libfaac. A reasonable range
for the option value is [10-500], the higher the value the higher the
quality.

This option is valid only using the @command{ffmpeg} command-line
tool. For library interface users, use @option{global_quality}.
@end table

@subsection Examples

@itemize
@item
Use @command{ffmpeg} to convert an audio file to ABR 128 kbps AAC in an M4A (MP4)
container:
@example

@end itemize

@anchor{libfdk-aac-enc}
@section libfdk_aac

libfdk-aac AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) encoder wrapper.

The libfdk-aac library is based on the Fraunhofer FDK AAC code from
the Android project.

Requires the presence of the libfdk-aac headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@code{--enable-libfdk-aac}. The library is also incompatible with GPL,
so if you allow the use of GPL, you should configure with
@code{--enable-gpl --enable-nonfree --enable-libfdk-aac}.

This encoder is considered to be of higher quality with respect to
both @ref{aacenc,,the native experimental FFmpeg AAC encoder} and
@ref{libfaac}.

VBR encoding, enabled through the @option{vbr} or @option{flags
+qscale} options, is experimental and only works with some
combinations of parameters.

Support for encoding 7.1 audio is only available with libfdk-aac 0.1.3 or
higher.

For more information see the fdk-aac project at
@url{http://sourceforge.net/p/opencore-amr/fdk-aac/}.

@subsection Options

platforms without an FPU, e.g. armel CPUs, and some phones and tablets.
However, as it is more targeted on performance than quality, it is not on par
with LAME and other production-grade encoders quality-wise. Also, according to
the project's homepage, this encoder may not be free of bugs as the code was
written a long time ago and the project was dead for at least 5 years.

This encoder only supports stereo and mono input. This is also CBR-only.

The original project (last updated in early 2007) is at
@url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/libshine-fxp/}. We only support the
updated fork by the Savonet/Liquidsoap project at @url{https://github.com/savonet/shine}.

Requires the presence of the libshine headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@code{--enable-libshine}.

@item constrained (@emph{cvbr})
Use constrained variable bit rate encoding.
@end table

@item compression_level (@emph{comp})
Set encoding algorithm complexity. Valid options are integers in
the 0-10 range. 0 gives the fastest encodes but lower quality, while 10
gives the highest quality but slowest encoding. The default is 10.

@item frame_duration (@emph{framesize})
Set maximum frame size, or duration of a frame in milliseconds. The
argument must be exactly the following: 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60. Smaller
frame sizes achieve lower latency but less quality at a given bitrate.
Sizes greater than 20ms are only interesting at fairly low bitrates.
The default is 20ms.

@item packet_loss (@emph{expect-loss})
Set expected packet loss percentage. The default is 0.

@item application (N.A.)
Set intended application type. Valid options are listed below:

@table @samp
@item voip
Favor improved speech intelligibility.
@item audio
Favor faithfulness to the input (the default).
@item lowdelay
Restrict to only the lowest delay modes.
@end table

@item cutoff (N.A.)
Set cutoff bandwidth in Hz. The argument must be exactly one of the
following: 4000, 6000, 8000, 12000, or 20000, corresponding to
narrowband, mediumband, wideband, super wideband, and fullband
respectively. The default is 0 (cutoff disabled).

@end table

@section libvorbis

libvorbis encoder wrapper.

Requires the presence of the libvorbisenc headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@code{--enable-libvorbis}.

@subsection Options

The following options are supported by the libvorbis wrapper. The
@command{oggenc}-equivalent of the options are listed in parentheses.

To get a more accurate and extensive documentation of the libvorbis
options, consult the libvorbisenc's and @command{oggenc}'s documentations.
See @url{http://xiph.org/vorbis/},
@url{http://wiki.xiph.org/Vorbis-tools}, and oggenc(1).

@table @option
@item b (@emph{-b})
Set bitrate expressed in bits/s for ABR. @command{oggenc} @option{-b} is
expressed in kilobits/s.

@item q (@emph{-q})
Set constant quality setting for VBR. The value should be a float
number in the range of -1.0 to 10.0. The higher the value, the better
the quality. The default value is @samp{3.0}.

This option is valid only using the @command{ffmpeg} command-line tool.
For library interface users, use @option{global_quality}.

@item cutoff (@emph{--advanced-encode-option lowpass_frequency=N})
Set cutoff bandwidth in Hz, a value of 0 disables cutoff. @command{oggenc}'s
related option is expressed in kHz. The default value is @samp{0} (cutoff

Set maximum bitrate expressed in bits/s. @command{oggenc} @option{-M} is
expressed in kilobits/s. This only has effect on ABR mode.

@item iblock (@emph{--advanced-encode-option impulse_noisetune=N})
Set noise floor bias for impulse blocks. The value is a float number from
-15.0 to 0.0. A negative bias instructs the encoder to pay special attention
to the crispness of transients in the encoded audio. The tradeoff for better
transient response is a higher bitrate.

@section libwebp

libwebp WebP Image encoder wrapper

libwebp is Google's official encoder for WebP images. It can encode in either
lossy or lossless mode. Lossy images are essentially a wrapper around a VP8
frame. Lossless images are a separate codec developed by Google.

@subsection Pixel Format

Currently, libwebp only supports YUV420 for lossy and RGB for lossless due
to limitations of the format and libwebp. Alpha is supported for either mode.
Because of API limitations, if RGB is passed in when encoding lossy or YUV is
passed in for encoding lossless, the pixel format will automatically be
converted using functions from libwebp. This is not ideal and is done only for
convenience.

@subsection Options

@table @option

@item -lossless @var{boolean}
Enables/Disables use of lossless mode. Default is 0.

@item -compression_level @var{integer}
For lossy, this is a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality
for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. For lossless, this is
a size/speed tradeoff. Higher values give smaller size at the cost of increased
encoding time. More specifically, it controls the number of extra algorithms
and compression tools used, and varies the combination of these tools. This
maps to the @var{method} option in libwebp. The valid range is 0 to 6.
Default is 4.

@item -qscale @var{float}
For lossy encoding, this controls image quality, 0 to 100. For lossless
encoding, this controls the effort and time spent at compressing more. The
default value is 75. Note that for usage via libavcodec, this option is called
@var{global_quality} and must be multiplied by @var{FF_QP2LAMBDA}.

@item -preset @var{type}
Configuration preset. This does some automatic settings based on the general
type of the image.
@table @option
@item none
Do not use a preset.
@item default
Use the encoder default.
@item picture
Digital picture, like portrait, inner shot
@item photo
Outdoor photograph, with natural lighting
@item drawing
Hand or line drawing, with high-contrast details
@item icon
Small-sized colorful images
@item text

@section libx264, libx264rgb

x264 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libx264 headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@code{--enable-libx264}.

libx264 supports an impressive number of features, including 8x8 and
4x4 adaptive spatial transform, adaptive B-frame placement, CAVLC/CABAC
entropy coding, interlacing (MBAFF), lossless mode, psy optimizations
for detail retention (adaptive quantization, psy-RD, psy-trellis).

Many libx264 encoder options are mapped to FFmpeg global codec
options, while unique encoder options are provided through private
options. Additionally the @option{x264opts} and @option{x264-params}
private options allows one to pass a list of key=value tuples as accepted
by the libx264 @code{x264_param_parse} function.

The x264 project website is at
@url{http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html}.

The libx264rgb encoder is the same as libx264, except it accepts packed RGB
pixel formats as input instead of YUV.

@subsection Supported Pixel Formats

x264 supports 8- to 10-bit color spaces. The exact bit depth is controlled at
x264's configure time. FFmpeg only supports one bit depth in one particular
build. In other words, it is not possible to build one FFmpeg with multiple
versions of x264 with different bit depths.

@subsection Options

The following options are supported by the libx264 wrapper. The
@command{x264}-equivalent options or values are listed in parentheses
for easy migration.

To reduce the duplication of documentation, only the private options
and some others requiring special attention are documented here. For
the documentation of the undocumented generic options, see

@item x264opts (N.A.)
Set any x264 option, see @command{x264 --fullhelp} for a list.

Argument is a list of @var{key}=@var{value} couples separated by
":". In @var{filter} and @var{psy-rd} options that use ":" as a separator
themselves, use "," instead. They accept it as well since long ago but this
is kept undocumented for some reason.

For example to specify libx264 encoding options with @command{ffmpeg}:
@example
ffmpeg -i foo.mpg -vcodec libx264 -x264opts keyint=123:min-keyint=20 -an out.mkv
@end example

@item a53cc @var{boolean}

Only the mpeg2 and h264 decoders provide these. Default is 0 (off).

@item x264-params (N.A.)
Override the x264 configuration using a :-separated list of key=value
parameters.

This option is functionally the same as the @option{x264opts}, but is
duplicated for compatibility with the Libav fork.

For example to specify libx264 encoding options with @command{ffmpeg}:
@example
ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v libx264 -x264-params level=30:bframes=0:weightp=0:\
cabac=0:ref=1:vbv-maxrate=768:vbv-bufsize=2000:analyse=all:me=umh:\
no-fast-pskip=1:subq=6:8x8dct=0:trellis=0 OUTPUT
@end example
@end table

Encoding ffpresets for common usages are provided so they can be used with the
general presets system (e.g. passing the @option{pre} option).

@section libx265

x265 H.265/HEVC encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libx265 headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@option{--enable-libx265}.

@subsection Options

@table @option
@item preset
Set the x265 preset.

@item tune
Set the x265 tune parameter.

@item x265-params

@end example
@end table

@section libxvid

Xvid MPEG-4 Part 2 encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libxvidcore headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@code{--enable-libxvid --enable-gpl}.

The native @code{mpeg4} encoder supports the MPEG-4 Part 2 format, so
users can encode to this format without this library.

@subsection Options

The following options are supported by the libxvid wrapper. Some of
the following options are listed but are not documented, and
correspond to shared codec options. See @ref{codec-options,,the Codec
Options chapter} for their documentation. The other shared options
which are not listed have no effect for the libxvid encoder.

@table @option
@item b

@item g

@item qmin

@item qmax

blocks search.
@end table

@item mbd
Set macroblock decision algorithm. Possible values in the increasing
order of quality:

@end table

@item lumi_aq
Enable lumi masking adaptive quantization when set to 1. Default is 0
(disabled).

@item variance_aq
Enable variance adaptive quantization when set to 1. Default is 0
(disabled).

When combined with @option{lumi_aq}, the resulting quality will not
be better than any of the two specified individually. In other
words, the resulting quality will be the worse one of the two
effects.

@item ssim
Set structural similarity (SSIM) displaying method. Possible values:

@table @samp
@item off
Disable displaying of SSIM information.

@item avg
Output average SSIM at the end of encoding to stdout. The format of
showing the average SSIM is:

@example
Average SSIM: %f
@end example

For users who are not familiar with C, %f means a float number, or
a decimal (e.g. 0.939232).

@item frame
Output both per-frame SSIM data during encoding and average SSIM at
the end of encoding to stdout. The format of per-frame information
is:

@example
       SSIM: avg: %1.3f min: %1.3f max: %1.3f
@end example

For users who are not familiar with C, %1.3f means a float number
rounded to 3 digits after the dot (e.g. 0.932).

@end table

@item ssim_acc
Set SSIM accuracy. Valid options are integers within the range of
0-4, while 0 gives the most accurate result and 4 computes the
fastest.

@end table

@item 1
@itemx always
Always write it.
@end table
@end table

@section png

@end table

@section ProRes

Apple ProRes encoder.

FFmpeg contains 2 ProRes encoders, the prores-aw and prores-ks encoder.
The used encoder can be chosen with the @code{-vcodec} option.

@subsection Private Options for prores-ks

@table @option
@item profile @var{integer}
Select the ProRes profile to encode
@table @samp
@item proxy
@item lt
@item standard
@item hq
@item 4444
@end table

@item quant_mat @var{integer}
Select quantization matrix.
@table @samp
@item auto
@item default
@item proxy
@item lt
@item standard
@item hq
@end table
If set to @var{auto}, the matrix matching the profile will be picked.
If not set, the matrix providing the highest quality, @var{default}, will be
picked.

@item bits_per_mb @var{integer}
How many bits to allot for coding one macroblock. Different profiles use
between 200 and 2400 bits per macroblock, the maximum is 8000.

@item mbs_per_slice @var{integer}
Number of macroblocks in each slice (1-8); the default value (8)
should be good in almost all situations.

@item vendor @var{string}
Override the 4-byte vendor ID.
A custom vendor ID like @var{apl0} would claim the stream was produced by
the Apple encoder.

@item alpha_bits @var{integer}
Specify number of bits for alpha component.
Possible values are @var{0}, @var{8} and @var{16}.
Use @var{0} to disable alpha plane coding.

@end table

@subsection Speed considerations

In the default mode of operation the encoder has to honor frame constraints
(i.e. not produce frames with size bigger than requested) while still making
output picture as good as possible.
A frame containing a lot of small details is harder to compress and the encoder
would spend more time searching for appropriate quantizers for each slice.

Setting a higher @option{bits_per_mb} limit will improve the speed.

For the fastest encoding speed set the @option{qscale} parameter (4 is the
recommended value) and do not set a size constraint.

@section libkvazaar

Kvazaar H.265/HEVC encoder.

Requires the presence of the libkvazaar headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@option{--enable-libkvazaar}.

@subsection Options

@table @option

@item b
Set target video bitrate in bit/s and enable rate control.

@item kvazaar-params
Set kvazaar parameters as a list of @var{name}=@var{value} pairs separated
by commas (,). See kvazaar documentation for a list of options.

@end table

@section QSV encoders

The family of Intel QuickSync Video encoders (MPEG-2, H.264 and HEVC)

The ratecontrol method is selected as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When @option{global_quality} is specified, a quality-based mode is used.
Specifically this means either
@itemize @minus
@item
@var{CQP} - constant quantizer scale, when the @option{qscale} codec flag is
also set (the @option{-qscale} avconv option).

@item
@var{LA_ICQ} - intelligent constant quality with lookahead, when the
@option{look_ahead} option is also set.

@item
@var{ICQ} -- intelligent constant quality otherwise.
@end itemize

@item
Otherwise, a bitrate-based mode is used. For all of those, you should specify at
least the desired average bitrate with the @option{b} option.
@itemize @minus
@item
@var{LA} - VBR with lookahead, when the @option{look_ahead} option is specified.

@item
@var{VCM} - video conferencing mode, when the @option{vcm} option is set.

@item
@var{CBR} - constant bitrate, when @option{maxrate} is specified and equal to
the average bitrate.

@item
@var{VBR} - variable bitrate, when @option{maxrate} is specified, but is higher
than the average bitrate.

@item
@var{AVBR} - average VBR mode, when @option{maxrate} is not specified. This mode
is further configured by the @option{avbr_accuracy} and
@option{avbr_convergence} options.
@end itemize
@end itemize

Note that depending on your system, a different mode than the one you specified
may be selected by the encoder. Set the verbosity level to @var{verbose} or
higher to see the actual settings used by the QSV runtime.

Additional libavcodec global options are mapped to MSDK options as follows:

@itemize
@item
@option{g/gop_size} -> @option{GopPicSize}

@item
@option{bf/max_b_frames}+1 -> @option{GopRefDist}

@item
@option{rc_init_occupancy/rc_initial_buffer_occupancy} ->
@option{InitialDelayInKB}

@item
@option{slices} -> @option{NumSlice}

@item
@option{refs} -> @option{NumRefFrame}

@item
@option{b_strategy/b_frame_strategy} -> @option{BRefType}

@item
@option{cgop/CLOSED_GOP} codec flag -> @option{GopOptFlag}

@item
For the @var{CQP} mode, the @option{i_qfactor/i_qoffset} and
@option{b_qfactor/b_qoffset} set the difference between @var{QPP} and @var{QPI},
and @var{QPP} and @var{QPB} respectively.

@item
Setting the @option{coder} option to the value @var{vlc} will make the H.264
encoder use CAVLC instead of CABAC.

@chapter Subtitles Encoders
@c man begin SUBTITLES ENCODERS

@section dvdsub

This codec encodes the bitmap subtitle format that is used in DVDs.
Typically they are stored in VOBSUB file pairs (*.idx + *.sub),
and they can also be used in Matroska files.

@subsection Options

@table @option
@item even_rows_fix
When set to 1, enable a work-around that makes the number of pixel rows
even in all subtitles.  This fixes a problem with some players that
cut off the bottom row if the number is odd.  The work-around just adds
a fully transparent row if needed.  The overhead is low, typically
one byte per subtitle on average.

By default, this work-around is disabled.
