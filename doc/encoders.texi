@chapter Encoders
@c man begin ENCODERS

Encoders are configured elements in Libav which allow the encoding of
multimedia streams.

When you configure your Libav build, all the supported native encoders
are enabled by default. Encoders requiring an external library must be enabled
manually via the corresponding @code{--enable-lib} option. You can list all
available encoders using the configure option @code{--list-encoders}.

You can disable all the encoders with the configure option
@code{--disable-encoders} and selectively enable / disable single encoders
with the options @code{--enable-encoder=@var{ENCODER}} /
@code{--disable-encoder=@var{ENCODER}}.

The option @code{-encoders} of the av* tools will display the list of
enabled encoders.

@chapter Audio Encoders
@c man begin AUDIO ENCODERS

A description of some of the currently available audio encoders
follows.

@section ac3 and ac3_fixed

AC-3 audio encoders.

These encoders implement part of ATSC A/52:2010 and ETSI TS 102 366, as well as
the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).

The @var{ac3} encoder uses floating-point math, while the @var{ac3_fixed}
encoder only uses fixed-point integer math. This does not mean that one is
always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
particular system. The floating-point encoder will generally produce better
quality audio for a given bitrate. The @var{ac3_fixed} encoder is not the
default codec for any of the output formats, so it must be specified explicitly
using the option @code{-acodec ac3_fixed} in order to use it.

@subsection AC-3 Metadata

The AC-3 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the audio,
but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some of the options
do directly affect or influence the decoding and playback of the resulting
bitstream, while others are just for informational purposes. A few of the
options will add bits to the output stream that could otherwise be used for
audio data, and will thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be
indicated accordingly with a note in the option list below.

These parameters are described in detail in several publicly-available
documents.

@end table

@subsubsection Audio Production Information
Audio Production Information is optional information describing the mixing
environment.  Either none or both of the fields are written to the bitstream.

@table @option

@item -mixing_level @var{number}
Mixing Level. Specifies peak sound pressure level (SPL) in the production
environment when the mix was mastered. Valid values are 80 to 111, or -1 for
unknown or not indicated. The default value is -1, but that value cannot be
used if the Audio Production Information is written to the bitstream. Therefore,
if the @code{room_type} option is not the default value, the @code{mixing_level}
option must not be -1.

@item -room_type @var{type}
Room Type. Describes the equalization used during the final mixing session at
the studio or on the dubbing stage. A large room is a dubbing stage with the
industry standard X-curve equalization; a small room has flat equalization.
This field will not be written to the bitstream if both the @code{mixing_level}
option and the @code{room_type} option have the default values.

Dialogue Normalization. Indicates how far the average dialogue level of the
program is below digital 100% full scale (0 dBFS). This parameter determines a
level shift during audio reproduction that sets the average volume of the
dialogue to a preset level. The goal is to match volume level between program
sources. A value of -31dB will result in no volume level change, relative to
the source volume, during audio reproduction. Valid values are whole numbers in
the range -31 to -1, with -31 being the default.

@item -dsur_mode @var{mode}
Dolby Surround Mode. Specifies whether the stereo signal uses Dolby Surround
(Pro Logic). This field will only be written to the bitstream if the audio
stream is stereo. Using this option does @b{NOT} mean the encoder will actually

@subsection Extended Bitstream Information
The extended bitstream options are part of the Alternate Bit Stream Syntax as
specified in Annex D of the A/52:2010 standard. It is grouped into 2 parts.
If any one parameter in a group is specified, all values in that group will be
written to the bitstream.  Default values are used for those that are written
but have not been specified.  If the mixing levels are written, the decoder
will use these values instead of the ones specified in the @code{center_mixlev}
and @code{surround_mixlev} options if it supports the Alternate Bit Stream
Syntax.

@subsection Other AC-3 Encoding Options

@table @option

@item -stereo_rematrixing @var{boolean}
Stereo Rematrixing. Enables/Disables use of rematrixing for stereo input. This
is an optional AC-3 feature that increases quality by selectively encoding
the left/right channels as mid/side. This option is enabled by default, and it
is highly recommended that it be left as enabled except for testing purposes.

@end table

@subheading Floating-Point-Only AC-3 Encoding Options

These options are only valid for the floating-point encoder and do not exist
for the fixed-point encoder due to the corresponding features not being
implemented in fixed-point.

@table @option

@item -channel_coupling @var{boolean}
Enables/Disables use of channel coupling, which is an optional AC-3 feature
that increases quality by combining high frequency information from multiple
channels into a single channel. The per-channel high frequency information is
sent with less accuracy in both the frequency and time domains. This allows
more bits to be used for lower frequencies while preserving enough information
to reconstruct the high frequencies. This option is enabled by default for the
floating-point encoder and should generally be left as enabled except for
testing purposes or to increase encoding speed.
@table @option
@item -1
@itemx auto
Selected by Encoder (default)
@item 0
@itemx off
Disable Channel Coupling
@item 1
@itemx on
Enable Channel Coupling
@end table

@item -cpl_start_band @var{number}
Coupling Start Band. Sets the channel coupling start band, from 1 to 15. If a
value higher than the bandwidth is used, it will be reduced to 1 less than the
coupling end band. If @var{auto} is used, the start band will be determined by
the encoder based on the bit rate, sample rate, and channel layout. This option
has no effect if channel coupling is disabled.
@table @option
@item -1
@itemx auto
Selected by Encoder (default)
@end table

@end table

@section libwavpack

A wrapper providing WavPack encoding through libwavpack.

Only lossless mode using 32-bit integer samples is supported currently.
The @option{compression_level} option can be used to control speed vs.
compression tradeoff, with the values mapped to libwavpack as follows:

@table @option

@item 0
Fast mode - corresponding to the wavpack @option{-f} option.

@item 1
Normal (default) settings.

@item 2
High quality - corresponding to the wavpack @option{-h} option.

@item 3
Very high quality - corresponding to the wavpack @option{-hh} option.

@item 4-8
Same as 3, but with extra processing enabled - corresponding to the wavpack
@option{-x} option. I.e. 4 is the same as @option{-x2} and 8 is the same as
@option{-x6}.

@chapter Video Encoders
@c man begin VIDEO ENCODERS

@section libwebp

libwebp WebP Image encoder wrapper

libwebp is Google's official encoder for WebP images. It can encode in either
lossy or lossless mode. Lossy images are essentially a wrapper around a VP8
frame. Lossless images are a separate codec developed by Google.

@subsection Pixel Format

Currently, libwebp only supports YUV420 for lossy and RGB for lossless due
to limitations of the format and libwebp. Alpha is supported for either mode.
Because of API limitations, if RGB is passed in when encoding lossy or YUV is
passed in for encoding lossless, the pixel format will automatically be
converted using functions from libwebp. This is not ideal and is done only for
convenience.

@subsection Options

@table @option

@item -lossless @var{boolean}
Enables/Disables use of lossless mode. Default is 0.

@item -compression_level @var{integer}
For lossy, this is a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality
for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. For lossless, this is
a size/speed tradeoff. Higher values give smaller size at the cost of increased
encoding time. More specifically, it controls the number of extra algorithms
and compression tools used, and varies the combination of these tools. This
maps to the @var{method} option in libwebp. The valid range is 0 to 6.
Default is 4.

@item -qscale @var{float}
For lossy encoding, this controls image quality, 0 to 100. For lossless
encoding, this controls the effort and time spent at compressing more. The
default value is 75. Note that for usage via libavcodec, this option is called
@var{global_quality} and must be multiplied by @var{FF_QP2LAMBDA}.

@item -preset @var{type}
Configuration preset. This does some automatic settings based on the general
type of the image.
@table @option
@item none
Do not use a preset.
@item default
Use the encoder default.
@item picture
Digital picture, like portrait, inner shot
@item photo
Outdoor photograph, with natural lighting
@item drawing
Hand or line drawing, with high-contrast details
@item icon
Small-sized colorful images
@item text
Text-like
@end table

@item lumi_aq
Enable lumi masking adaptive quantization when set to 1. Default is 0
(disabled).

@item variance_aq
Enable variance adaptive quantization when set to 1. Default is 0
(disabled).

When combined with @option{lumi_aq}, the resulting quality will not
be better than any of the two specified individually. In other
words, the resulting quality will be the worse one of the two
effects.

@item ssim
Set structural similarity (SSIM) displaying method. Possible values:

@table @samp
@item off
Disable displaying of SSIM information.

@item avg
Output average SSIM at the end of encoding to stdout. The format of
showing the average SSIM is:

@example
Average SSIM: %f
@end example

For users who are not familiar with C, %f means a float number, or
a decimal (e.g. 0.939232).

@item frame
Output both per-frame SSIM data during encoding and average SSIM at
the end of encoding to stdout. The format of per-frame information
is:

@example
       SSIM: avg: %1.3f min: %1.3f max: %1.3f
@end example

For users who are not familiar with C, %1.3f means a float number
rounded to 3 digits after the dot (e.g. 0.932).

@end table

@item ssim_acc
Set SSIM accuracy. Valid options are integers within the range of
0-4, while 0 gives the most accurate result and 4 computes the
fastest.

@end table

@section libx264

x264 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoder wrapper

x264 supports an impressive number of features, including 8x8 and 4x4 adaptive
spatial transform, adaptive B-frame placement, CAVLC/CABAC entropy coding,
interlacing (MBAFF), lossless mode, psy optimizations for detail retention
(adaptive quantization, psy-RD, psy-trellis).

The Libav wrapper provides a mapping for most of them using global options
that match those of the encoders and provides private options for the unique
encoder options. Additionally an expert override is provided to directly pass
a list of key=value tuples as accepted by x264_param_parse.

@subsection Speed considerations

In the default mode of operation the encoder has to honor frame constraints
(i.e. not produce frames with a size larger than requested) while still making
the output picture as good as possible.
A frame containing a lot of small details is harder to compress and the encoder
would spend more time searching for appropriate quantizers for each slice.

Setting a higher @option{bits_per_mb} limit will improve the speed.

For the fastest encoding speed set the @option{qscale} parameter (4 is the
recommended value) and do not set a size constraint.

@item
When @option{global_quality} is specified, a quality-based mode is used.
Specifically this means either
@itemize @minus
@item
@var{CQP} - constant quantizer scale, when the @option{qscale} codec flag is
also set (the @option{-qscale} avconv option).

@item
@var{LA_ICQ} - intelligent constant quality with lookahead, when the
@option{la_depth} option is also set.

@item
@var{ICQ} -- intelligent constant quality otherwise.
@end itemize

@item
Otherwise, a bitrate-based mode is used. For all of those, you should specify at
least the desired average bitrate with the @option{b} option.
@itemize @minus
@item
@var{LA} - VBR with lookahead, when the @option{la_depth} option is specified.

@item
@var{VCM} - video conferencing mode, when the @option{vcm} option is set.

@item
@var{CBR} - constant bitrate, when @option{maxrate} is specified and equal to
the average bitrate.

@item
@var{VBR} - variable bitrate, when @option{maxrate} is specified, but is higher
than the average bitrate.

@item
@var{AVBR} - average VBR mode, when @option{maxrate} is not specified. This mode
is further configured by the @option{avbr_accuracy} and
@option{avbr_convergence} options.
@end itemize
@end itemize

Note that depending on your system, a different mode than the one you specified
may be selected by the encoder. Set the verbosity level to @var{verbose} or
higher to see the actual settings used by the QSV runtime.

Additional libavcodec global options are mapped to MSDK options as follows:

@itemize
@item
@option{g/gop_size} -> @option{GopPicSize}

@item
@option{bf/max_b_frames}+1 -> @option{GopRefDist}

@item
@option{rc_init_occupancy/rc_initial_buffer_occupancy} ->
@option{InitialDelayInKB}

@item
@option{slices} -> @option{NumSlice}

@item
@option{refs} -> @option{NumRefFrame}

@item
@option{b_strategy/b_frame_strategy} -> @option{BRefType}

@item
@option{cgop/CLOSED_GOP} codec flag -> @option{GopOptFlag}

@item
For the @var{CQP} mode, the @option{i_qfactor/i_qoffset} and
@option{b_qfactor/b_qoffset} set the difference between @var{QPP} and @var{QPI},
and @var{QPP} and @var{QPB} respectively.

@item
Setting the @option{coder} option to the value @var{vlc} will make the H.264
encoder use CAVLC instead of CABAC.
