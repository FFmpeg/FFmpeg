@chapter Device Options
@c man begin DEVICE OPTIONS

The libavdevice library provides the same interface as
libavformat. Namely, an input device is considered like a demuxer, and
an output device like a muxer, and the interface and generic device
options are the same provided by libavformat (see the ffmpeg-formats
manual).

In addition each input or output device may support so-called private
options, which are specific for that component.

Options may be set by specifying -@var{option} @var{value} in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the device
@code{AVFormatContext} options or using the @file{libavutil/opt.h} API
for programmatic use.
