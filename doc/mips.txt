MIPS optimizations info
===============================================

MIPS optimizations of codecs are targeting MIPS 74k family of
CPUs. Some of these optimizations are relying more on properties of
this architecture and some are relying less (and can be used on most
MIPS architectures without degradation in performance).

Along with FFMPEG copyright notice, there is MIPS copyright notice in
all the files that are created by people from MIPS Technologies.
