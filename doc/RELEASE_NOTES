Release Notes
=============

* 0.10 "Freedom"  January, 2012


General notes
-------------
See the Changelog file for a list of significant changes. Note, there
are many more new features and bugfixes than whats listed there.

Bugreports against FFmpeg git master or the most recent FFmpeg release are
accepted. If you are experiencing issues with any formally released version of
FFmpeg, please try git master to check if the issue still exists. If it does,
make your report against the development code following the usual bug reporting
guidelines.

Of big interest to our Windows users, FFmpeg now supports building with the MSVC
compiler. Since MSVC does not support C99 features used extensively by FFmpeg,
this has been accomplished using a converter that turns C99 code to C89. See the
platform-specific documentation for more detailed documentation on building
FFmpeg with MSVC.
