Release Notes
=============

* 0.8 "Love"  June, 2011
* 0.7 "Peace" June, 2011 (identical to 0.8 but using 0.6 ABI/API)


General notes
-------------

This release enables frame-based multithreaded decoding for a number of codecs,
including theora, huffyuv, VP8, H.263, mpeg4 and H.264. Additionally, there has
been a major cleanup of
both internal and external APIs. For this reason, the major versions of all
libraries except libpostproc have been bumped. This means that 0.8 can be installed
side-by-side with previous releases, on the other hand applications need to be
recompiled to use 0.8.

Other important changes are more than 200 bugfixes, known regressions were fixed
w.r.t 0.5 and 0.6, additions of decoders including, but not limited to,
AMR-WB, single stream LATM/LOAS, G.722 ADPCM, a native VP8 decoder
and HE-AACv2. Additionally, many new de/muxers such as WebM in Matroska, Apple
HTTP Live Streaming, SAP, IEC 61937 (S/PDIF) have been added.

See the Changelog file for a list of significant changes.

Bugreports against FFmpeg git master or the most recent FFmpeg release are
accepted. If you are experiencing issues with any formally released version of
FFmpeg, please try git master to check if the issue still exists. If it does,
make your report against the development code following the usual bug reporting
guidelines.

Note, if you have difficulty building for mingw, try --disable-outdev=sdl
