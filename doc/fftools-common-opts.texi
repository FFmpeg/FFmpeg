All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept in input
a string representing a number, which may contain one of the
International System number postfixes, for example 'K', 'M', 'G'.
If 'i' is appended after the postfix, powers of 2 are used instead of
powers of 10. The 'B' postfix multiplies the value for 8, and can be
appended after another postfix or used alone. This allows using for
example 'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as postfix.

Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
with "no" the option name, for example using "-nofoo" in the
commandline will set to false the boolean option with name "foo".

@section Generic options

These options are shared amongst the ff* tools.

@table @option

@item -L
Show license.

@item -h, -?, -help, --help
Show help.

@item -version
Show version.

@item -formats
Show available formats.

The fields preceding the format names have the following meanings:
@table @samp
@item D
Decoding available
@item E
Encoding available
@end table

@item -codecs
Show available codecs.

The fields preceding the codec names have the following meanings:
@table @samp
@item D
Decoding available
@item E
Encoding available
@item V/A/S
Video/audio/subtitle codec
@item S
Codec supports slices
@item D
Codec supports direct rendering
@item T
Codec can handle input truncated at random locations instead of only at frame boundaries
@end table

@item -bsfs
Show available bitstream filters.

@item -protocols
Show available protocols.

@item -filters
Show available libavfilter filters.

@item -pix_fmts
Show available pixel formats.

@item -loglevel @var{loglevel}
Set the logging level used by the library.
@var{loglevel} is a number or a string containing one of the following values:
@table @samp
@item quiet
@item panic
@item fatal
@item error
@item warning
@item info
@item verbose
@item debug
@end table

By default the program logs to stderr, if coloring is supported by the
terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log coloring
can be disabled setting the environment variable
@env{FFMPEG_FORCE_NOCOLOR} or @env{NO_COLOR}, or can be forced setting
the environment variable @env{FFMPEG_FORCE_COLOR}.
The use of the environment variable @env{NO_COLOR} is deprecated and
will be dropped in a following FFmpeg version.

@end table

@section AVOptions

These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
@option{-help} option. They are separated into two categories:
@table @option
@item generic
These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic options are
listed under AVFormatContext options for containers/devices and under
AVCodecContext options for codecs.
@item private
These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private
options are listed under their corresponding containers/devices/codecs.
@end table

For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
an MP3 file, use the @option{id3v2_version} private option of the MP3
muxer:
@example
ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3
@end example

You can precisely specify which stream(s) should the codec AVOption apply to by
appending a stream specifier of the form
@option{[:@var{stream_type}][:@var{stream_index}]} to the option name.
@var{stream_type} is 'v' for video, 'a' for audio and 's' for subtitle streams.
@var{stream_index} is a global stream index when @var{stream_type} isn't
given, otherwise it counts streams of the given type only. As always, the index
is zero-based. For example
@example
-foo -- applies to all applicable streams
-foo:v -- applies to all video streams
-foo:a:2 -- applies to the third audio stream
-foo:0 -- applies to the first stream
@end example

Note -nooption syntax cannot be used for boolean AVOptions, use -option
0/-option 1.

Note2 old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by prepending
v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be removed soon.
