All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the SI
unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.

If 'i' is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples, which are based on
powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the SI unit
prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example:
'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.

Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
the option name with "no". For example using "-nofoo"
will set the boolean option with name "foo" to false.

@anchor{Stream specifiers}
@section Stream specifiers
Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers
are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.

A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
separated from it by a colon. E.g. @code{-codec:a:1 ac3} contains the
@code{a:1} stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it
would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all
of them. E.g. the stream specifier in @code{-b:a 128k} matches all audio
streams.

An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, @code{-codec copy}
or @code{-codec: copy} would copy all the streams without reencoding.

Possible forms of stream specifiers are:
@table @option
@item @var{stream_index}
Matches the stream with this index. E.g. @code{-threads:1 4} would set the
thread count for the second stream to 4.
@item @var{stream_type}[:@var{stream_index}]
@var{stream_type} is one of following: 'v' or 'V' for video, 'a' for audio, 's'
for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. 'v' matches all video
streams, 'V' only matches video streams which are not attached pictures, video
thumbnails or cover arts.  If @var{stream_index} is given, then it matches
stream number @var{stream_index} of this type. Otherwise, it matches all
streams of this type.
@item p:@var{program_id}[:@var{stream_index}]
If @var{stream_index} is given, then it matches the stream with number @var{stream_index}
in the program with the id @var{program_id}. Otherwise, it matches all streams in the
program.
@item #@var{stream_id} or i:@var{stream_id}
Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).
@item m:@var{key}[:@var{value}]
Matches streams with the metadata tag @var{key} having the specified value. If
@var{value} is not given, matches streams that contain the given tag with any
value.
@item u
Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be defined and the
essential information such as video dimension or audio sample rate must be present.

Note that in @command{ffmpeg}, matching by metadata will only work properly for
input files.
@end table

@section Generic options

These options are shared amongst the ff* tools.

@table @option

@item -L
Show license.

@item -h, -?, -help, --help [@var{arg}]

Show available demuxers.

@item -muxers
Show available muxers.

@item -devices
Show available devices.

@item -codecs
Show all codecs known to libavcodec.

@item -sources @var{device}[,@var{opt1}=@var{val1}[,@var{opt2}=@var{val2}]...]
Show autodetected sources of the intput device.
Some devices may provide system-dependent source names that cannot be autodetected.
The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.
@example
ffmpeg -sources pulse,server=192.168.0.4
@end example

@item -sinks @var{device}[,@var{opt1}=@var{val1}[,@var{opt2}=@var{val2}]...]
Show autodetected sinks of the output device.
Some devices may provide system-dependent sink names that cannot be autodetected.
The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.
@example
ffmpeg -sinks pulse,server=192.168.0.4
@end example

@item -loglevel [repeat+]@var{loglevel} | -v [repeat+]@var{loglevel}
Set the logging level used by the library.
Adding "repeat+" indicates that repeated log output should not be compressed
to the first line and the "Last message repeated n times" line will be
omitted. "repeat" can also be used alone.
If "repeat" is used alone, and with no prior loglevel set, the default
loglevel will be used. If multiple loglevel parameters are given, using
'repeat' will not change the loglevel.
@var{loglevel} is a string or a number containing one of the following values:
@table @samp
@item quiet, -8
Show nothing at all; be silent.
@item panic, 0
Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash, such as
an assertion failure. This is not currently used for anything.
@item fatal, 8
Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the process absolutely
cannot continue.
@item error, 16
Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.
@item warning, 24
Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to possibly
incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.
@item info, 32
Show informative messages during processing. This is in addition to
warnings and errors. This is the default value.
@item verbose, 40
Same as @code{info}, except more verbose.
@item debug, 48
Show everything, including debugging information.
@item trace, 56
@end table

By default the program logs to stderr. If coloring is supported by the
terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log coloring
can be disabled setting the environment variable
@env{AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR} or @env{NO_COLOR}, or can be forced setting
the environment variable @env{AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR}.
The use of the environment variable @env{NO_COLOR} is deprecated and
will be dropped in a future FFmpeg version.

@item -report
Dump full command line and console output to a file named
@code{@var{program}-@var{YYYYMMDD}-@var{HHMMSS}.log} in the current
directory.
This file can be useful for bug reports.
It also implies @code{-loglevel verbose}.

Setting the environment variable @env{FFREPORT} to any value has the
same effect. If the value is a ':'-separated key=value sequence, these
options will affect the report; option values must be escaped if they
contain special characters or the options delimiter ':' (see the
``Quoting and escaping'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual).

The following options are recognized:
@table @option
@item file
set the file name to use for the report; @code{%p} is expanded to the name
of the program, @code{%t} is expanded to a timestamp, @code{%%} is expanded
to a plain @code{%}
@item level
set the log verbosity level using a numerical value (see @code{-loglevel}).
@end table

For example, to output a report to a file named @file{ffreport.log}
using a log level of @code{32} (alias for log level @code{info}):

@example
FFREPORT=file=ffreport.log:level=32 ffmpeg -i input output
@end example

Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal, and will not
appear in the report.

@item -hide_banner
Suppress printing banner.

All FFmpeg tools will normally show a copyright notice, build options
and library versions. This option can be used to suppress printing
this information.

@item -cpuflags flags (@emph{global})
Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended
for testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing.
@example
ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...
ffmpeg -cpuflags mmx ...
ffmpeg -cpuflags 0 ...
@end example
Possible flags for this option are:

@item -opencl_bench
This option is used to benchmark all available OpenCL devices and print the
results. This option is only available when FFmpeg has been compiled with
@code{--enable-opencl}.

When FFmpeg is configured with @code{--enable-opencl}, the options for the
global OpenCL context are set via @option{-opencl_options}. See the
"OpenCL Options" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual for the complete list of
supported options. Amongst others, these options include the ability to select
a specific platform and device to run the OpenCL code on. By default, FFmpeg
will run on the first device of the first platform. While the options for the
global OpenCL context provide flexibility to the user in selecting the OpenCL
device of their choice, most users would probably want to select the fastest
OpenCL device for their system.

This option assists the selection of the most efficient configuration by
identifying the appropriate device for the user's system. The built-in
benchmark is run on all the OpenCL devices and the performance is measured for
each device. The devices in the results list are sorted based on their
performance with the fastest device listed first. The user can subsequently
invoke @command{ffmpeg} using the device deemed most appropriate via
@option{-opencl_options} to obtain the best performance for the OpenCL
accelerated code.

Typical usage to use the fastest OpenCL device involve the following steps.

Run the command:
@example
ffmpeg -opencl_bench
@end example
Note down the platform ID (@var{pidx}) and device ID (@var{didx}) of the first
i.e. fastest device in the list.
Select the platform and device using the command:
@example
ffmpeg -opencl_options platform_idx=@var{pidx}:device_idx=@var{didx} ...
@end example

@item -opencl_options options (@emph{global})
Set OpenCL environment options. This option is only available when
FFmpeg has been compiled with @code{--enable-opencl}.

@var{options} must be a list of @var{key}=@var{value} option pairs
separated by ':'. See the ``OpenCL Options'' section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual for the list of supported options.
@end table

@section AVOptions

These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
@option{-help} option. They are separated into two categories:
@table @option
@item generic
These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic options
are listed under AVFormatContext options for containers/devices and under
AVCodecContext options for codecs.
@item private
These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private
options are listed under their corresponding containers/devices/codecs.
@end table

For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
an MP3 file, use the @option{id3v2_version} private option of the MP3
muxer:
@example
ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3
@end example

All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier
should be attached to them.

Note: the @option{-nooption} syntax cannot be used for boolean
AVOptions, use @option{-option 0}/@option{-option 1}.

Note: the old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by
prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be
removed soon.
