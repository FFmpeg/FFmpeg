@chapter Description
@c man begin DESCRIPTION

The libavutil library is a utility library to aid portable
multimedia programming. It contains safe portable string functions,
random number generators, data structures, additional mathematics
functions, cryptography and multimedia related functionality (like
enumerations for pixel and sample formats). It is not a library for
code needed by both libavcodec and libavformat.

The goals for this library is to be:

@table @strong
@item Modular
It should have few interdependencies and the possibility of disabling individual
parts during @command{./configure}.

@item Small
Both sources and objects should be small.

@item Efficient
It should have low CPU and memory usage.

@item Useful
It should avoid useless features that almost no one needs.
