@chapter Decoders
@c man begin DECODERS

Decoders are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow the decoding of
multimedia streams.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported native decoders
are enabled by default. Decoders requiring an external library must be enabled
manually via the corresponding @code{--enable-lib} option. You can list all
available decoders using the configure option @code{--list-decoders}.

You can disable all the decoders with the configure option
@code{--disable-decoders} and selectively enable / disable single decoders
with the options @code{--enable-decoder=@var{DECODER}} /
@code{--disable-decoder=@var{DECODER}}.

The option @code{-decoders} of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled decoders.

@chapter Audio Decoders
@c man begin AUDIO DECODERS

A description of some of the currently available audio decoders
follows.

@section ac3

AC-3 audio decoder.

This decoder implements part of ATSC A/52:2010 and ETSI TS 102 366, as well as
the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).

@subsection AC-3 Decoder Options

@table @option

@item -drc_scale @var{value}
Dynamic Range Scale Factor. The factor to apply to dynamic range values
from the AC-3 stream. This factor is applied exponentially.
There are 3 notable scale factor ranges:
@table @option
@item drc_scale == 0
DRC disabled. Produces full range audio.
@item 0 < drc_scale <= 1
DRC enabled.  Applies a fraction of the stream DRC value.
Audio reproduction is between full range and full compression.
@item drc_scale > 1
DRC enabled. Applies drc_scale asymmetrically.
Loud sounds are fully compressed.  Soft sounds are enhanced.

This decoder aims to implement the complete FLAC specification from Xiph.

@subsection FLAC Decoder options

@table @option

@item -use_buggy_lpc

(like the default value). This option makes it possible to decode such streams
correctly by using lavc's old buggy lpc logic for decoding.

use is purely internal and the format of the data it accepts is not publicly
documented.

@chapter Subtitles Decoders
@c man begin SUBTILES DECODERS

@section libaribb24

ARIB STD-B24 caption decoder.

Implements profiles A and C of the ARIB STD-B24 standard.

@subsection libaribb24 Decoder Options

@table @option

@item -aribb24-base-path @var{path}
Sets the base path for the libaribb24 library. This is utilized for reading of
configuration files (for custom unicode conversions), and for dumping of
non-text symbols as images under that location.

Unset by default.

@item -aribb24-skip-ruby-text @var{boolean}
Tells the decoder wrapper to skip text blocks that contain half-height ruby
text.

Enabled by default.

@end table

@section dvbsub

@subsection Options

@table @option
@item compute_clut
@table @option
@item -1
Compute clut if no matching CLUT is in the stream.
@item 0
Never compute CLUT
@item 1
Always compute CLUT and override the one provided in the stream.
@end table
@item dvb_substream
Selects the dvb substream, or all substreams if -1 which is default.

@end table

@section dvdsub

This codec decodes the bitmap subtitles used in DVDs; the same subtitles can
also be found in VobSub file pairs and in some Matroska files.

@subsection Options

@table @option
@item palette
Specify the global palette used by the bitmaps. When stored in VobSub, the
palette is normally specified in the index file; in Matroska, the palette is
stored in the codec extra-data in the same format as in VobSub. In DVDs, the
palette is stored in the IFO file, and therefore not available when reading
from dumped VOB files.

The format for this option is a string containing 16 24-bits hexadecimal
numbers (without 0x prefix) separated by comas, for example @code{0d00ee,
ee450d, 101010, eaeaea, 0ce60b, ec14ed, ebff0b, 0d617a, 7b7b7b, d1d1d1,
7b2a0e, 0d950c, 0f007b, cf0dec, cfa80c, 7c127b}.

@item ifo_palette
Specify the IFO file from which the global palette is obtained.
(experimental)

@item forced_subs_only
Only decode subtitle entries marked as forced. Some titles have forced
and non-forced subtitles in the same track. Setting this flag to @code{1}
will only keep the forced subtitles. Default value is @code{0}.
@end table

@section libzvbi-teletext

Libzvbi allows libavcodec to decode DVB teletext pages and DVB teletext
subtitles. Requires the presence of the libzvbi headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
@code{--enable-libzvbi}.

@subsection Options

@table @option
@item txt_page
List of teletext page numbers to decode. Pages that do not match the specified
list are dropped. You may use the special @code{*} string to match all pages,
or @code{subtitle} to match all subtitle pages.
Default value is *.
@item txt_chop_top
Discards the top teletext line. Default value is 1.
@item txt_format
Specifies the format of the decoded subtitles.
@table @option
@item bitmap
The default format, you should use this for teletext pages, because certain
graphics and colors cannot be expressed in simple text or even ASS.
@item text
Simple text based output without formatting.
@item ass
Formatted ASS output, subtitle pages and teletext pages are returned in
different styles, subtitle pages are stripped down to text, but an effort is
made to keep the text alignment and the formatting.
@end table
@item txt_left
X offset of generated bitmaps, default is 0.
@item txt_top
Y offset of generated bitmaps, default is 0.
@item txt_chop_spaces
Chops leading and trailing spaces and removes empty lines from the generated
text. This option is useful for teletext based subtitles where empty spaces may
be present at the start or at the end of the lines or empty lines may be
present between the subtitle lines because of double-sized teletext characters.
Default value is 1.
@item txt_duration
Sets the display duration of the decoded teletext pages or subtitles in
milliseconds. Default value is -1 which means infinity or until the next
subtitle event comes.
@item txt_transparent
Force transparent background of the generated teletext bitmaps. Default value
is 0 which means an opaque background.
@item txt_opacity
Sets the opacity (0-255) of the teletext background. If
@option{txt_transparent} is not set, it only affects characters between a start
box and an end box, typically subtitles. Default value is 0 if
@option{txt_transparent} is set, 255 otherwise.
