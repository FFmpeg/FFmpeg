Cronjobs:

Part of the docs is in the main ffmpeg repository as texi files, this part is build by a cronjob. So is the
doxygen stuff as well as the FFmpeg git snapshot.
These 3 scripts are under the ffcron user



Git:
~~~~
Public facing git is provided by our infra, (https://git.ffmpeg.org/gitweb)
main developer ffmpeg git repository for historic reasons is provided by (git@source.ffmpeg.org:ffmpeg)
Other developer git repositories are provided via git@git.ffmpeg.org:<NAME_OF_REPOSITORY>
git mirrors are available on https://github.com/FFmpeg
(there are some exceptions where primary repositories are on github or elsewhere instead of the mirrors)

Github mirrors are redundantly synced by multiple people
