Tag description:
----------------

version
    0
    this MUST NOT change within a bitstream

always_reset
    if 1 then the range coder contexts will be reset after each frame

temporal_decomposition_type
    0

temporal_decomposition_count
    0

spatial_decomposition_count
    FIXME

colorspace_type
    0
    this MUST NOT change within a bitstream

chroma_h_shift
    log2(luma.width / chroma.width)
    this MUST NOT change within a bitstream

chroma_v_shift
    log2(luma.height / chroma.height)
    this MUST NOT change within a bitstream

spatial_scalability
    0

max_ref_frames
    maximum number of reference frames
    this MUST NOT change within a bitstream

ref_frames
    minimum of the number of available reference frames and max_ref_frames
    for example the first frame after a key frame always has ref_frames=1

spatial_decomposition_type
    wavelet type
    0 is a 9/7 symmetric compact integer wavelet
    1 is a 5/3 symmetric compact integer wavelet
    others are reserved
    stored as delta from last, last is reset to 0 if always_reset || keyframe

qlog
    quality (logarthmic quantizer scale)
    stored as delta from last, last is reset to 0 if always_reset || keyframe

mv_scale
    stored as delta from last, last is reset to 0 if always_reset || keyframe
    FIXME check that everything works fine if this changes between frames

qbias
    dequantization bias
    stored as delta from last, last is reset to 0 if always_reset || keyframe

block_max_depth
    maximum depth of the block tree
    stored as delta from last, last is reset to 0 if always_reset || keyframe

quant_table
    quantiztation table

Range Coder:
============
FIXME

Neighboring Blocks:
===================
left and top are set to the respective blocks unless they are outside of
the image in which case they are set to the Null block

top-left is set to the top left block unless it is outside of the image in
which case it is set to the left block

if this block has no larger parent block or it is at the left side of its
parent block and the top right block is not outside of the image then the
top right block is used for top-right else the top-left block is used

Null block
y,cb,cr are 128
level, ref, mx and my are 0


Motion Vector Prediction:
=========================
1. the motion vectors of all the neighboring blocks are scaled to
compensate for the difference of reference frames

scaled_mv= (mv * (256 * (current_reference+1) / (mv.reference+1)) + 128)>>8

2. the median of the scaled left, top and top-right vectors is used as
motion vector prediction

3. the used motion vector is the sum of the predictor and
   (mvx_diff, mvy_diff)*mv_scale


Intra DC Predicton:
======================
the luma and chroma values of the left block are used as predictors

the used luma and chroma is the sum of the predictor and y_diff, cb_diff, cr_diff


Motion Compensation:
====================
FIXME

LL band prediction:
===================
FIXME

Dequantizaton:
==============
FIXME

Wavelet Transform:
==================
FIXME

TODO:
=====
Important:
finetune initial contexts
spatial_decomposition_count per frame?
flip wavelet?
try to use the wavelet transformed predicted image (motion compensated image) as context for coding the residual coefficients
try the MV length as context for coding the residual coefficients
use extradata for stuff which is in the keyframes now?
the MV median predictor is patented IIRC

Not Important:
spatial_scalability b vs u (!= 0 breaks syntax anyway so we can add a u later)
