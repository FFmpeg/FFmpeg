SNOW Video Codec Specification Draft 20070103
=============================================

Intro:
======
This Specification describes the snow syntax and semmantics as well as
how to decode snow.
The decoding process is precissely described and any compliant decoder
MUST produce the exactly same output for a spec conformant snow stream.
For encoding though any process which generates a stream compliant to
the syntactical and semmantical requirements and which is decodeable by
the process described in this spec shall be considered a conformant
snow encoder.

Definitions:
============

MUST    the specific part must be done to conform to this standard
SHOULD  it is recommended to be done that way, but not strictly required

ilog2(x) is the rounded down logarithm of x with basis 2
ilog2(0) = 0

Type definitions:
=================

b   1-bit range coded
u   unsigned scalar value range coded
s   signed scalar value range coded

Range Coder:
============
FIXME

Neighboring Blocks:
===================
left and top are set to the respective blocks unless they are outside of
the image in which case they are set to the Null block

top-left is set to the top left block unless it is outside of the image in
which case it is set to the left block

if this block has no larger parent block or it is at the left side of its
parent block and the top right block is not outside of the image then the
top right block is used for top-right else the top-left block is used

Null block
y,cb,cr are 128
level, ref, mx and my are 0


Motion Vector Prediction:
=========================
1. the motion vectors of all the neighboring blocks are scaled to
compensate for the difference of reference frames

scaled_mv= (mv * (256 * (current_reference+1) / (mv.reference+1)) + 128)>>8

2. the median of the scaled left, top and top-right vectors is used as
motion vector prediction

3. the used motion vector is the sum of the predictor and
   (mvx_diff, mvy_diff)*mv_scale


Intra DC Predicton:
======================
the luma and chroma values of the left block are used as predictors

the used luma and chroma is the sum of the predictor and y_diff, cb_diff, cr_diff


Motion Compensation:

FIXME

LL band prediction:

Dequantizaton:

FIXME

Wavelet Transform:
==================

Snow supports 2 wavelet transforms, the symmetric biorthogonal 5/3 integer
transform and a integer approximation of the symmetric biorthogonal 9/7
daubechies wavelet.

2D IDWT (inverse discrete wavelet transform)
--------------------------------------------
The 2D IDWT applies a 2D filter recursively, each time combining the
4 lowest frequency subbands into a single subband until only 1 subband
remains.
The 2D filter is done by first applying a 1D filter in the vertical direction
and then applying it in the horizontal one.

1D Filter:
----------
1. interleave the samples of the low and high frequency subbands like
s={L0, H0, L1, H1, L2, H2, L3, H3, ... }
note, this can end with a L or a H, the number of elements shall be w
s[-1] shall be considered equivalent to s[1  ]
s[w ] shall be considered equivalent to s[w-2]

2. perform the lifting steps in order as described below

5/3 Integer filter:
1. s[i] -= (s[i-1] + s[i+1] + 2)>>2; for all even i < w
2. s[i] += (s[i-1] + s[i+1]    )>>1; for all odd  i < w

snows 9/7 Integer filter:
1. s[i] -= (3*(s[i-1] + s[i+1])         + 4)>>3; for all even i < w
2. s[i] -=     s[i-1] + s[i+1]                 ; for all odd  i < w
3. s[i] += (   s[i-1] + s[i+1] + 4*s[i] + 8)>>4; for all even i < w

TODO:
=====
Important:
finetune initial contexts
spatial_decomposition_count per frame?
flip wavelet?
try to use the wavelet transformed predicted image (motion compensated image) as context for coding the residual coefficients
try the MV length as context for coding the residual coefficients
use extradata for stuff which is in the keyframes now?
the MV median predictor is patented IIRC

Not Important:
spatial_scalability b vs u (!= 0 breaks syntax anyway so we can add a u later)
