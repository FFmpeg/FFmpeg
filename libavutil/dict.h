/**

 * Public dictionary API.
 * @deprecated
 *  AVDictionary is provided for compatibility with libav. It is both in
 *  implementation as well as API inefficient. It does not scale and is
 *  extremely slow with large dictionaries.
 *  It is recommended that new code uses our tree container from tree.c/h
 *  where applicable, which uses AVL trees to achieve O(log n) performance.

 * @brief Simple key:value store
 *
 * @{
 * Dictionaries are used for storing key:value pairs. To create
 * an AVDictionary, simply pass an address of a NULL pointer to
 * av_dict_set(). NULL can be used as an empty dictionary wherever
 * a pointer to an AVDictionary is required.
 * Use av_dict_get() to retrieve an entry or iterate over all
 * entries and finally av_dict_free() to free the dictionary
 * and all its contents.
 *
 @code
   AVDictionary *d = NULL;           // "create" an empty dictionary
   AVDictionaryEntry *t = NULL;

   av_dict_set(&d, "foo", "bar", 0); // add an entry

   char *k = av_strdup("key");       // if your strings are already allocated,
   char *v = av_strdup("value");     // you can avoid copying them like this
   av_dict_set(&d, k, v, AV_DICT_DONT_STRDUP_KEY | AV_DICT_DONT_STRDUP_VAL);

   while (t = av_dict_get(d, "", t, AV_DICT_IGNORE_SUFFIX)) {
       <....>                             // iterate over all entries in d
   }
   av_dict_free(&d);
