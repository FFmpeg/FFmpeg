/**
 * Buffer to print data progressively
 *
 * The string buffer grows as necessary and is always 0-terminated.
 * The content of the string is never accessed, and thus is
 * encoding-agnostic and can even hold binary data.
 *
 * Small buffers are kept in the structure itself, and thus require no
 * memory allocation at all (unless the contents of the buffer is needed
 * after the structure goes out of scope). This is almost as lightweight as
 * declaring a local "char buf[512]".
 *
 * The length of the string can go beyond the allocated size: the buffer is
 * then truncated, but the functions still keep account of the actual total
 * length.
 *
 * In other words, buf->len can be greater than buf->size and records the
 * total length of what would have been to the buffer if there had been
 * enough memory.
 *
 * Append operations do not need to be tested for failure: if a memory
 * allocation fails, data stop being appended to the buffer, but the length
 * is still updated. This situation can be tested with
 * av_bprint_is_complete().
 *
 * The size_max field determines several possible behaviours:
 *
 * size_max = -1 (= UINT_MAX) or any large value will let the buffer be
 * reallocated as necessary, with an amortized linear cost.
 *
 * size_max = 0 prevents writing anything to the buffer: only the total
 * length is computed. The write operations can then possibly be repeated in
 * a buffer with exactly the necessary size
 * (using size_init = size_max = len + 1).
 *
 * size_max = 1 is automatically replaced by the exact size available in the
 * structure itself, thus ensuring no dynamic memory allocation. The
 * internal buffer is large enough to hold a reasonable paragraph of text,
 * such as the current paragraph.
