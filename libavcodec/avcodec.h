/**
 * @ingroup libavc
 * @defgroup lavc_encdec send/receive encoding and decoding API overview
 * @{
 *
 * The avcodec_send_packet()/avcodec_receive_frame()/avcodec_send_frame()/
 * avcodec_receive_packet() functions provide an encode/decode API, which
 * decouples input and output.
 *
 * The API is very similar for encoding/decoding and audio/video, and works as
 * follows:
 * - Set up and open the AVCodecContext as usual.
 * - Send valid input:
 *   - For decoding, call avcodec_send_packet() to give the decoder raw
 *     compressed data in an AVPacket.
 *   - For encoding, call avcodec_send_frame() to give the encoder an AVFrame
 *     containing uncompressed audio or video.
 *
 *   In both cases, it is recommended that AVPackets and AVFrames are
 *   refcounted, or libavcodec might have to copy the input data. (libavformat
 *   always returns refcounted AVPackets, and av_frame_get_buffer() allocates
 *   refcounted AVFrames.)
 * - Receive output in a loop. Periodically call one of the avcodec_receive_*()
 *   functions and process their output:
 *   - For decoding, call avcodec_receive_frame(). On success, it will return
 *     an AVFrame containing uncompressed audio or video data.
 *   - For encoding, call avcodec_receive_packet(). On success, it will return
 *     an AVPacket with a compressed frame.
 *
 *   Repeat this call until it returns AVERROR(EAGAIN) or an error. The
 *   AVERROR(EAGAIN) return value means that new input data is required to
 *   return new output. In this case, continue with sending input. For each
 *   input frame/packet, the codec will typically return 1 output frame/packet,
 *   but it can also be 0 or more than 1.
 *
 * At the beginning of decoding or encoding, the codec might accept multiple
 * input frames/packets without returning a frame, until its internal buffers
 * are filled. This situation is handled transparently if you follow the steps
 * outlined above.
 *
 * In theory, sending input can result in EAGAIN - this should happen only if
 * not all output was received. You can use this to structure alternative decode
 * or encode loops other than the one suggested above. For example, you could
 * try sending new input on each iteration, and try to receive output if that
 * returns EAGAIN.
 *
 * End of stream situations. These require "flushing" (aka draining) the codec,
 * as the codec might buffer multiple frames or packets internally for
 * performance or out of necessity (consider B-frames).
 * This is handled as follows:
 * - Instead of valid input, send NULL to the avcodec_send_packet() (decoding)
 *   or avcodec_send_frame() (encoding) functions. This will enter draining
 *   mode.
 * - Call avcodec_receive_frame() (decoding) or avcodec_receive_packet()
 *   (encoding) in a loop until AVERROR_EOF is returned. The functions will
 *   not return AVERROR(EAGAIN), unless you forgot to enter draining mode.
 * - Before decoding can be resumed again, the codec has to be reset with
 *   avcodec_flush_buffers().
 *
 * Using the API as outlined above is highly recommended. But it is also
 * possible to call functions outside of this rigid schema. For example, you can
 * call avcodec_send_packet() repeatedly without calling
 * avcodec_receive_frame(). In this case, avcodec_send_packet() will succeed
 * until the codec's internal buffer has been filled up (which is typically of
 * size 1 per output frame, after initial input), and then reject input with
 * AVERROR(EAGAIN). Once it starts rejecting input, you have no choice but to
 * read at least some output.
 *
 * Not all codecs will follow a rigid and predictable dataflow; the only
 * guarantee is that an AVERROR(EAGAIN) return value on a send/receive call on
 * one end implies that a receive/send call on the other end will succeed, or
 * at least will not fail with AVERROR(EAGAIN). In general, no codec will
 * permit unlimited buffering of input or output.
 *
 * This API replaces the following legacy functions:
 * - avcodec_decode_video2() and avcodec_decode_audio4():
 *   Use avcodec_send_packet() to feed input to the decoder, then use
 *   avcodec_receive_frame() to receive decoded frames after each packet.
 *   Unlike with the old video decoding API, multiple frames might result from
 *   a packet. For audio, splitting the input packet into frames by partially
 *   decoding packets becomes transparent to the API user. You never need to
 *   feed an AVPacket to the API twice (unless it is rejected with AVERROR(EAGAIN) - then
 *   no data was read from the packet).
 *   Additionally, sending a flush/draining packet is required only once.
 * - avcodec_encode_video2()/avcodec_encode_audio2():
 *   Use avcodec_send_frame() to feed input to the encoder, then use
 *   avcodec_receive_packet() to receive encoded packets.
 *   Providing user-allocated buffers for avcodec_receive_packet() is not
 *   possible.
 * - The new API does not handle subtitles yet.
 *
 * Mixing new and old function calls on the same AVCodecContext is not allowed,
 * and will result in undefined behavior.
 *
 * Some codecs might require using the new API; using the old API will return
 * an error when calling it. All codecs support the new API.
 *
 * A codec is not allowed to return AVERROR(EAGAIN) for both sending and receiving. This
 * would be an invalid state, which could put the codec user into an endless
 * loop. The API has no concept of time either: it cannot happen that trying to
 * do avcodec_send_packet() results in AVERROR(EAGAIN), but a repeated call 1 second
 * later accepts the packet (with no other receive/flush API calls involved).
 * The API is a strict state machine, and the passage of time is not supposed
 * to influence it. Some timing-dependent behavior might still be deemed
 * acceptable in certain cases. But it must never result in both send/receive
 * returning EAGAIN at the same time at any point. It must also absolutely be
 * avoided that the current state is "unstable" and can "flip-flop" between
 * the send/receive APIs allowing progress. For example, it's not allowed that
 * the codec randomly decides that it actually wants to consume a packet now
 * instead of returning a frame, after it just returned AVERROR(EAGAIN) on an
 * avcodec_send_packet() call.

/**
 * Create and return a AVHWFramesContext with values adequate for hardware
 * decoding. This is meant to get called from the get_format callback, and is
 * a helper for preparing a AVHWFramesContext for AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx.
 * This API is for decoding with certain hardware acceleration modes/APIs only.
 *
 * The returned AVHWFramesContext is not initialized. The caller must do this
 * with av_hwframe_ctx_init().
 *
 * Calling this function is not a requirement, but makes it simpler to avoid
 * codec or hardware API specific details when manually allocating frames.
 *
 * Alternatively to this, an API user can set AVCodecContext.hw_device_ctx,
 * which sets up AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx fully automatically, and makes
 * it unnecessary to call this function or having to care about
 * AVHWFramesContext initialization at all.
 *
 * There are a number of requirements for calling this function:
 *
 * - It must be called from get_format with the same avctx parameter that was
 *   passed to get_format. Calling it outside of get_format is not allowed, and
 *   can trigger undefined behavior.
 * - The function is not always supported (see description of return values).
 *   Even if this function returns successfully, hwaccel initialization could
 *   fail later. (The degree to which implementations check whether the stream
 *   is actually supported varies. Some do this check only after the user's
 *   get_format callback returns.)
 * - The hw_pix_fmt must be one of the choices suggested by get_format. If the
 *   user decides to use a AVHWFramesContext prepared with this API function,
 *   the user must return the same hw_pix_fmt from get_format.
 * - The device_ref passed to this function must support the given hw_pix_fmt.
 * - After calling this API function, it is the user's responsibility to
 *   initialize the AVHWFramesContext (returned by the out_frames_ref parameter),
 *   and to set AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx to it. If done, this must be done
 *   before returning from get_format (this is implied by the normal
 *   AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx API rules).
 * - The AVHWFramesContext parameters may change every time time get_format is
 *   called. Also, AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx is reset before get_format. So
 *   you are inherently required to go through this process again on every
 *   get_format call.
 * - It is perfectly possible to call this function without actually using
 *   the resulting AVHWFramesContext. One use-case might be trying to reuse a
 *   previously initialized AVHWFramesContext, and calling this API function
 *   only to test whether the required frame parameters have changed.
 * - Fields that use dynamically allocated values of any kind must not be set
 *   by the user unless setting them is explicitly allowed by the documentation.
 *   If the user sets AVHWFramesContext.free and AVHWFramesContext.user_opaque,
 *   the new free callback must call the potentially set previous free callback.
 *   This API call may set any dynamically allocated fields, including the free
 *   callback.
 *
 * The function will set at least the following fields on AVHWFramesContext
 * (potentially more, depending on hwaccel API):
 *
 * - All fields set by av_hwframe_ctx_alloc().
 * - Set the format field to hw_pix_fmt.
 * - Set the sw_format field to the most suited and most versatile format. (An
 *   implication is that this will prefer generic formats over opaque formats
 *   with arbitrary restrictions, if possible.)
 * - Set the width/height fields to the coded frame size, rounded up to the
 *   API-specific minimum alignment.
 * - Only _if_ the hwaccel requires a pre-allocated pool: set the initial_pool_size
 *   field to the number of maximum reference surfaces possible with the codec,
 *   plus 1 surface for the user to work (meaning the user can safely reference
 *   at most 1 decoded surface at a time), plus additional buffering introduced
 *   by frame threading. If the hwaccel does not require pre-allocation, the
 *   field is left to 0, and the decoder will allocate new surfaces on demand
 *   during decoding.
 * - Possibly AVHWFramesContext.hwctx fields, depending on the underlying
 *   hardware API.
 *
 * Essentially, out_frames_ref returns the same as av_hwframe_ctx_alloc(), but
 * with basic frame parameters set.
 *
 * The function is stateless, and does not change the AVCodecContext or the
 * device_ref AVHWDeviceContext.
 *
 * @param avctx The context which is currently calling get_format, and which
 *              implicitly contains all state needed for filling the returned
 *              AVHWFramesContext properly.
 * @param device_ref A reference to the AVHWDeviceContext describing the device
 *                   which will be used by the hardware decoder.
 * @param hw_pix_fmt The hwaccel format you are going to return from get_format.
 * @param out_frames_ref On success, set to a reference to an _uninitialized_
 *                       AVHWFramesContext, created from the given device_ref.
 *                       Fields will be set to values required for decoding.
 *                       Not changed if an error is returned.
 * @return zero on success, a negative value on error. The following error codes
 *         have special semantics:
 *      AVERROR(ENOENT): the decoder does not support this functionality. Setup
 *                       is always manual, or it is a decoder which does not
 *                       support setting AVCodecContext.hw_frames_ctx at all,
 *                       or it is a software format.
 *      AVERROR(EINVAL): it is known that hardware decoding is not supported for
 *                       this configuration, or the device_ref is not supported
 *                       for the hwaccel referenced by hw_pix_fmt.
